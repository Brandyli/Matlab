#### Instead of changing the index value, try using a slider to select any column in spectra.

## Stellar Motion II


In the previous project, you determined if one star's spectrum was redshifted or blueshifted, 
and calculated the starâ€™s speed relative to the Earth. In this project, you will calculate all the stars' speed at once. 
Then you'll create the plot below.

```
load starData

Task 1
% You could repeat the calculations in a for loop, 
% but it is more efficient to use array operations instead.
[sHa,idx] = min(spectra);
lambdaHa = lambda(idx);
z = lambdaHa/656.28 - 1;
speed = z*299792.458

Tasks 2 - 4
% Since the plot command won't be the same for every star, 
% it's convenient to use a for loop
for v = 1:7
    s = spectra(:,v);

    if speed(v) <= 0
        % plot the blueshifted spectra using dashed lines.
        loglog(lambda,s,"--")
    else
        % plot the redshifted spectra using a thick line
       loglog(lambda,s,"LineWidth",3) 
    end
    hold on
end
hold off
Task 5
% Add a legend to the plot using the array starnames
legend(starnames)
```
Task 6
%Use logical indexing to find elements that match a condition.
movaway = starnames(speed>0)
```
